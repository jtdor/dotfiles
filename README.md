# dotfiles
Just a synchronization place for some dotfiles. Nothing special, but feel free
to have a look.

## Usage Reminder
Use [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to symlink dotfiles from the repository to the home directory, e.g.:
```sh
dotfiles$ stow -t ~ bash git vim
```
There is a `.stowrc` with useful options.
